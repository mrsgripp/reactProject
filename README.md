Sam and Sara React Project 

Project Requirements:

All browsers today come with CORS restrictions
"Cross Origin Response"
Our browser will refuse to allow HTTP requests when the server has not verified which actions are permissible for the browser to perform (the server first needs to tell us which HTTP verbs we are allowed to use, which host URLs are allowed to communicate, and which HTTP headers are allowed to be used)
"pre-flight check"
to fix this, we'll need to add a little bit of Javalin configuation to our backend first. Landing page, with links to Sellers page
It should load all seller information on startup and display
a small menu for adding a new seller Product page
Should display all products on startup
Every product may have a menu for either updating the product or deleting the product
A button that shows/hides this menu for the individual product
A small menu for posting a new product We'll need to know how to use Props States Conditional rendering Routing Optional items:
"page not found" page
dark/light mode made with react contex
